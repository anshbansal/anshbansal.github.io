    "- conveying a story or idea as efficiently as possible\n",
    "- a picture is worth a thousand words\n",
    "- how best to represent visually underlying data using color, size, shape\n",
    "- mapping values to visuals\n",
    "- instead of looking at columns of data we can looks to bars, lines, graphs of different colors\n",
    "- turning numbers into pictures and stories\n",
    "- our visual systems are much faster in processing the information\n",

    "## Good Data visualizations\n",
    "Exploratory\n",
    "- trying to find insights - what the data is, what can it tell you\n",
    "- turning 100 rocks to find 1 or 2 good nuggets\n",
    "- connect things in interesting ways\n",
