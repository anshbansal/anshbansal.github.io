    "### Common distributions in online data\n",
    "Let’s talk about some common distributions that come up when you look at real user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s measure the rate at which users click on a result on our search page, analogously, we could measure the average staytime on the results page before traveling to a result. In this case, you’d probably see what we call a [Poisson distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), or that the stay times would be [exponentially distributed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common distribution of user data is a “power-law,” [Zipfian or Pareto distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution). That basically means that the probability of a more extreme value, z, decreases like 1/z (or 1/z^exponent). This distribution also comes up in other rare events such as the frequency of words in a text (the most common word is really really common compared to the next word on the list). These types of heavy-tailed distributions are common in internet data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you may have data that is a composition of different distributions - latency often has this characteristic because users on fast internet connection form one group and users on dial-up or cell phone networks form another. Even on mobile phones you may have differences between carriers, or newer cell phones vs. older text-based displays. This forms what is called a mixture distribution that can be hard to detect or characterize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here is not to necessarily come up with a distribution to match if the answer isn’t clear - that can be helpful - but to choose summary statistics that make the most sense for what you do have. If you have a distribution that is lopsided with a very long tail, choosing the mean probably doesn’t work for you very well - and in the case of something like the Pareto, the mean may be infinite!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sensitivity and Robustness of metrics\n",
    "- sensitivity means it moves when interesting things happen\n",
    "- robustness means it doesn't move when non-interesting things happen\n",
    "- in case of load times\n",
    "    - mean can be used but any outlier load time which is quite high will cause the mean to move a lot. It is not robust\n",
    "    - median can be used as it won't move much due to few changes but that is a weakness also. If a small fraction of users are affected then it will not move much\n",
    "    - maybe 90th or 99th percentile is better option in this case.\n",
    "- how to measure\n",
    "    - do an experiment\n",
    "        - e.g. increase quality of video. The load time should increase. See whether the metric moves as we want it to move\n",
    "    - do an A/A test\n",
    "        - Compare without changing anything.\n",

    "The ones that are moving around are not robust enough for comparable videos. So 90th and 99th percentile are not robust enough\n",

    "\n",
    "### Relative differences in probabilities\n",
    "For probability metrics, people often use percentage points to refer to absolute differences and percentages to refer to relative differences. For example, if your control click-through-probability were 5%, and your experiment click-through-probability were 7%, the absolute difference would be 2 percentage points, and the relative difference would be 40 percent. However, sometimes people will refer to the absolute difference as a 2 percent change, so if someone gives you a percentage, it's important to clarify whether they mean a relative or absolute difference!\n",
