    "* Google [tested 41 different shades of blue](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html?pagewanted=3).\n",
    "* Amazon initially decided to launch their first personalized product recommendations based on an [A/B test showing a huge revenue increase by adding that feature](http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/GuideControlledExperiments.pdf). (See the second paragraph in the introduction.)\n",
    "* LinkedIn [tested whether to use the top slot on a user's stream for top news articles or an encouragement to add more contacts](http://engineering.linkedin.com/mobile/mobile-ab-testing-linkedin-how-members-shape-our-apps). (See the first paragraph in \"A/B testing with view based JSON\" section.)\n",
    "* Amazon determined that [every 100ms increase in page load time decreased sales by 1%](http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/IEEEComputer2007OnlineExperiments.pdf). (In \"Secondary metrics\" section on the last page)\n",
    "* Googleâ€™s [latency results](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/speed-matters.html) showed a similar impact for a 100ms delay.\n",

    "* Kayak [tested whether notifying users that their payment was encrypted would make users more or less likely to complete the payment](http://apptimize.com/blog/2014/03/kayaks-most-interesting-ab-test/).\n",
    "* Khan Academy tests [changes like letting students know how many other students are working on the exercise with them, or making it easier for students to fast-forward past skills they already have](http://apptimize.com/blog/2014/07/how-khan-academy-uses-ab-testing-to-improve-student-learning/).

The site will show one distribution as bars and the other as dots, and two graphs will be shown. The top graph shows the probability that exactly some number of successes k will occur for each k, and the bottom graph shows the cumulative probability that at k or fewer successes will occur (so the probability on the far right (k >= n) will always be 1).\n",
