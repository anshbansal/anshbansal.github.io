    "- Good sample size\n",
    "- Representative sample\n",
    "- Sound Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructs\n",
    "- We have constructs i.e. things that are difficult to measure. e.g. Intelligence, Effort, Hunger. \n",
    "- To properly measure them we need a operational definition i.e. a definition that allows us to properly measure them\n",

    "Lurking variables\n",
    "- Whenever analyzing data we should think about externeous factors that we may not have thought about. These are called lurking variables. \n",
    "- If we hold more things constant then our confidence in results becomes more as we are bringing down lurking variables\n",

    "- A subset of people from population is a sample\n",

    "    - $\\bar{x}$ is average of sample\n",
    "- sampling error = $\\bar{x}$ - $\\mu$\n",
    "- Although $\\bar{x}$ is not the same as $\\mu$ it can give us an interval in which $\\mu$ lies as long as we have large enough random unbiased sample"
