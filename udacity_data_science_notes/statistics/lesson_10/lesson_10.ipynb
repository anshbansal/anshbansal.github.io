    "Till now we were using $\\sigma$ to find standard error. But we cannot do that as we don't have $\\sigma$. So we have a different distribution that is more error prone. It is t-distribution\n",

    "Basically the number of actual choices that you could make excluding the ones that are forced due to constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sample taken from a population our choice of sample is constrained by the population itself. We cannot pick something that isn't there. If we a good sample (large enough, completely representative of the population and chosen by a sound methodology) then we could at most choose n - 1 points. The last point would be chosen for us (by our methodology of taking good sample rather than someone choosing it for us).\n",
