    "\n",
    "For a sample taken from a population our choice of sample is constrained by the population itself. We cannot pick something that isn't there. If we a good sample (large enough, completely representative of the population and chosen by a sound methodology) then we could at most choose n - 1 points. The last point would be chosen for us (by our methodology of taking good sample rather than someone choosing it for us).\n",
